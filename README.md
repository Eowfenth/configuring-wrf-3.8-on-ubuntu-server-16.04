These are some installation notes taken in the process of installing WRF version 3.8 on a computer with Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS.

## Install required software
```console
$ sudo apt−get install build−essential csh gfortran m4
```

## System environment tests

First and foremost, it is very important to have a gfortran compiler, as well as gcc and cpp. If you have these installed, you should be given a path for the location of each.
```console
$ which gfortran
/user/bin/gfortran
$ which cpp
/user/bin/cpp
$ which gcc
/user/bin/gcc
```

Check your gcc version. It is recommend using version 4.4.0 or later.
```console
$ gcc −−version
gcc (Ubuntu 5.3.1−14ubuntu2.1) 5.3.1 20160413

```

Create a new, clean directory called `Build_WRF`, and another one called `TESTS`.

There are a few simple tests that can be run to verify that the fortran compiler is built properly, and that it is compatible with the C compiler. Download the tar file that contains the tests into the `TESTS` directory and unpack the tar file.
```console
$ cd {path_to_dir}/TESTS
$ wget http ://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compile_tutorial/tar_files/Fortran_C_tests.tar
$ tar −xvf Fortran_C_tests.tar
```

There are 7 tests available, so start at the top and run through them, one at a time.

* Test 1: Fixed Format Fortran Test.
```console
$ gfortran TEST_1_fortran_only_fixed.f
$ ./a.out
SUCCESS test 1 fortran only fixed format
```

* Test 2: Free Format Fortran.
```console
$ gfortran TEST_2_fortran_only_free.f90
$ ./a.out
Assume Fortran 2003: has FLUSH, ALLOCATABLE, derived type, and ISO C Binding
SUCCESS test 2 fortran only free format
```

* Test 3: C.
```console
$ gcc TEST_3_c_only.c
$ ./a.out
SUCCESS test 3 c only
```

* Test 4: Fortran Calling a C Function (our gcc and gfortran have different defaults, so we force both to always use 64 bit [-m64] when combining them).
```console
$ gcc −c −m64 TEST_4_fortran+c_c.c
$ gfortran −c −m64 TEST_4_fortran+c_f.f90
$ gfortran −m64 TEST_4_fortran+c_f.o TEST_4_fortran+c_c.o
$ ./a.out
C function called by Fortran Values are xx = 2.00 and ii = 1
SUCCESS test 4 fortran calling c
```

In addition to the compilers required to manufacture the WRF executables, the WRF build system has scripts as the top level for the user interface. The WRF scripting system uses, and therefore is necessary having csh, perl and sh.
To test whether these scripting languages are working properly on the system, there are 3 tests to run. These tests were included in the "Fortran and C Tests Tar File".

* Test 5: csh.
```console
$ csh ./TEST_csh.csh
SUCCESS csh test
```

* Test 6: perl.
```console
$ ./TEST_perl.pl
SUCCESS perl test
```

* Test 7: sh.
```console
$ ./TEST_sh.sh
SUCCESS sh test
```
